# **Project 1 Outline**
## **VeggieLife**
> University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp / Summer 2018

### **PROJECT SUMMARY**
> Our app is based on three principles:  
> 1. We love veggiesâ€”both the green edibles and the folks who eat them! 
> 2. There is a growing awareness in the US about the benefits of eating a plant-based diet. As a result, the demand for vegetarian restaurants and restaurants that serve veggie-friendly dishes has increased.
> 3. We have created a website that empowers users to find vegetarian options regardless of where they are. Whether you are traveling or trying to find a veggie-friendly spot to meet the dietary preferences of the whole group, VeggieLife is site to find suggestions, ratings, price points, and research about the best options in town.
